# 🎵 Spotify Audio Features Recommender

An end-to-end **Music Recommender System** built with the [Spotify Audio Features dataset (Tomigelo)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features).  
The system uses **content-based filtering** with track audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.) to recommend similar songs.

---

## 📌 Features
- Loads Spotify Audio Features dataset (CSV)
- Builds a **content-based recommender** using `NearestNeighbors`
- Evaluates recommendations with **Hit-Rate@K**
- Inspect recommendations for any chosen seed track
- Clean, modular Python implementation

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-recommender.git
   cd spotify-recommender
````

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```

4. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features)
   Place `SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv` inside the project folder.

## 🚀 Usage

A) By track name/artist query (most convenient)
python recommender_tomigelo.py --csv SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --seed-query "shape of you ed sheeran" --top 15


The script will:

Show top 10 matches for your query (track name + artist).

Auto-pick the first match as the seed.

Print the Top 15 recommended tracks with similarity.

B) By exact track_id (if you already know it)
python recommender_tomigelo.py --csv SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --seed-id 7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3 --top 10

C) Multiple seeds (centroid of several songs)
python recommender_tomigelo.py --csv SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --multi-seed-ids 7qiZfU4dY1lWllzX7mPBI3,0tgVpDi06FyKpA1z0VMD4v --top 20

D) Faster testing on a subset
python recommender_tomigelo.py --csv SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --seed-query "arijit singh" --top 10 --subset 50000

E) Save recommendations to a CSV
python recommender_tomigelo.py --csv SpotifyAudioFeaturesApril2019.csv --seed-query "dil diyan gallan" --top 25 --out recs.csv

4) What the output looks like

Example (columns may vary slightly based on your seed):

=== Recommendations ===
 rank                track_name      artist_name                     track_id  popularity  similarity  distance
    1                    Perfect        Ed Sheeran  0tgVpDi06FyKpA1z0VMD4v          85       0.952     0.048
    2                    Happier        Ed Sheeran  2RttW7RAu5nOAfq6YFvApB          83       0.948     0.052
    3                 Photograph        Ed Sheeran  1HNkqx9Ahdgi1Ixy2xkKkL          82       0.941     0.059
    ...


similarity = 1 − cosine_distance (closer to 1.0 is more similar).

If popularity exists, it’s shown too (0–100).

## 🧠 How it Works

1. Selects key **audio features** (`danceability`, `energy`, `tempo`, etc.).
2. Scales features with `StandardScaler`.
3. Uses `NearestNeighbors` (cosine similarity) to find similar tracks.
4. Evaluates recommendations using **Hit-Rate\@K**:

   * Pick an artist with ≥2 songs
   * Use one song as the "seed"
   * Hide another song as the "target"
   * Success if target appears in the top-K recommendations

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

* **Hit-Rate\@K**: Fraction of test cases where at least one hidden track from the same artist is retrieved in the top-K recommendations.
* Example: Hit-Rate\@10 = 0.42 → in 42% of cases, the system found a same-artist track in the top-10.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add **Streamlit UI** for interactive recommendations
* Use **Spotify Web API** for live playlists
* Try **matrix factorization** or **deep learning embeddings**
* Hybrid approach: combine **content-based** + **collaborative filtering**
